vitutor
=======

It is a copy of a tutorial was written by Michael C. Pierce and Robert K. Ware, Colorado School of Mines using ideas supplied by Charles Smith, Colorado State University.

>>VI is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to explain in a tutor such as this.  This tutor is designed to describe enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use VI as an all-purpose editor.
The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 25-30 minutes, depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.
It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by use.  That means that the student needs to execute the commands to learn them properly.
